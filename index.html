        <h3 class="section-title">Background</h3>
        <p>Zannah was a Human girl from the planet Somov Rit.[1] Born in 1010 BBY,[2] her youth was spent with her cousins,[6] Darovit, Hardin, and Root, and per the custom of the people of that world, was known by her nickname Rain. Unlike Darovit and Hardin, Rain had not shown any sign of Force potential, so, when Jedi scout Torr Snapit of the Army of Light arrived looking to recruit Force-sensitives to fight in the war against the Sith, he was initially hesitant to take her. Rain did not want to be left behind while her cousins went away with the Jedi, and with assistance from Darovit, she manipulated the Force sufficiently for Snapit to allow her to come along. Rain joined her cousins as they went off-world to partake in the war's final campaign on the planet Ruusan.[1]</p>

        <p>Darth Zannah has been instinctively using Force energy since she was a young girl. She was discovered by Darth Bane and agreed to be his apprentice. Zannah constructed her personal double-bladed lightsaber. Her customized weapon included a longer than average hilt and was powered by a set of synthetic lightsaber crystals, one of which was known as Bane's Heart.</p>
